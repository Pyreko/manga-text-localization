# manga-text-localization

OCRs text.  Intended for use with manga pages, but could probably be extended to other uses.

Note this is not complete!  As such, it won't work really well.

## To use:

1.  Create a venv
2.  Make, which will download the pip reqs.
3.  Run using ``python3 image_localization.py`` or just ``./image_localization.py``.  Look at the command line options for what you can pass in.
